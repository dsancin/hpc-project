# Exercise 2
This directory contains the results of the analyses of the OBLAS and MKL libraries:
* `strong_scalability` folder contains the .csv of the data collected studying the strong scalability running the gemm function using single and double precision.
* `weak_scalability` folder contains the .csv of the data collected studying the weak scalability running the gemm function using single and double precision.
* `graphs` folder contains the .csv files with the data collected, and the graphs folder contains the produced graphs and the code used to produce them (`graphs.ipynb`)
* `weak_script.sh` and `strong_script.sh` are two examples of the scripts used to run the tests
